# Social-Engineering-and-Phishing-Lab
The goal of this project is to utilize the Social Engineering Toolkit to clone a website login page, send a seemingly legitimate email from that company with hidden links to the false webpage, and then acquire the victim's login credentials.

# Description
Disclaimer: More information on this lab can be found on Dr. Bryson Payne's Udemy course, Real World Ethical Hacking: Hands-on Cybersecurity (https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-ethical-hacking/). I have augmented it in some ways to go deeper into the topic but that is the basis of the lab. Please note that I am by no means an expert in the field, and am open to corrections if any methods could be improved.

This lab will guide the reader through the steps to a relatively complex social engineering attack in a simplified manner. It will cover the following steps:
1) Planning your attack
     a. Choosing a target
     b. Choosing a website
     c. Planning your delivery

2) Executing your Attack
     a. Masking your IP
     b. Cloning the website
     c. Crafting the phishing email

3) Post-Exploitation
     a. Potential use of credentials

The purpose of this lab is to inform the reader of how easily an attacker can craft a powerful social engineering attack, identify the key indicators of an attack, and prove to the reader why reusing passwords can be incredibly dangerous.

To follow along, all you will need is Kali Linux downloaded and access to the internet.
